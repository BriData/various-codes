                                                  Nasdaq Inc has provided block- chain technology to run a new exchange to trade guaranteed advertising contracts as more mainstream finance projects using the record-keeping soft- ware move into the real world.The New York Interactive Advertising Exchange (NY- IAX), which is set to launch in the fourth quarter of 2017, will provide an electronic marketplace for publishers, advertisers and media buyers to buy and sell future advertis- ing inventory, global exchange operator Nasdaq and NYIAX said Tuesday.Participants in the exchange will forward-like contracts, or agreements to buy and sell an asset at a specified price and a set future date.  The goal is to offer a more efficient and transparent way for players in the advertising market to sell and buy inventory, NYIAX executives said.NYIAX’s platform was built using Nasdaq’s exchange technology, which incorporates blockchain as its core ledger for transactions.Blockchain, which first emerged as the system under- pinning cryptocurrency bit- coin, is a distributed record of asset ownership that is main- tained by a network of comput- ers, rather than a centralized authority. Any change to the ledger must be approved by all participants on the network, making it tamper-proof with and an ideal tool for auditing.Financial institutions have been ramping their investment in the technology in the hopes that it can provide a simpler, cheaper and more transpar- ent way to run some of their processes, such as the clearing and settlement of securities.Nasdaq, one of the world’slargest providers of technol- ogy for exchanges and clearing houses, has been an outspoken supporter of the technology on Wall Street.It now uses blockchain to power its US market for shares of private companies and has been testing it to run proxy vot- ing for companies listed on its exchange in Estonia.It revealed last year that it was planning to integrate blockchain in the technology it sells to other exchanges.Reuters
